Singapore is a modern affluent city combining of skyscrappers, industrial estates and broad transport routes. The population of Singapore sizes to more than five millions and makes the state a densely populated country.\n\nUnlike the other densely populated countries, 50% the Singapore land is covered by greenery. With more than 50 nature parks and four reservoirs its a beautiful garden city.",

Singapore is well connected to its nook and corners by roads and public transport system.\nAs such it will be highly unlikely that a buyer will consider the distance to workplace as a major factor for buying a house. This project will provide a meaningful insight of the other convinience factors that influence the pricing of HDB flats.\nThis analysis will be also interesting for the people who aspiring to relocate to a different town as they gain insight of the most common venues of their interests.",

HDB Resale Flat Prices\nThis dataset is compiled by the Housing Development Board of Singapore and available for public use in data.gov.sg. This data comprises the price data from year 2017 January till 2019 August. We will make use of the year 2019 data. 'Apartment Block' or simply 'Block' is the trem used for a residential apartment building and 'Unit' or 'Flat'for a single apartment in the Block in Singapore. Flat prices within a block has variation due to the factors like - total floor area, number of rooms and unit level (storey) in the block. Since the project is not focusing on pricing recommendation, we will be using an average price of a unit in the block by minimizing the variables. This data contains the features 'month', 'town', 'flat_type', 'block', 'street_name', 'storey_range', 'floor_area_sqm', 'flat_model', 'lease_commence_date', 'remaining_lease' and 'resale_price'. 'resale_price' is our target value.\n#### Lets have a look at our HDB resale raw data\n",

We have the public data sets - 'Electoral Boundary Data', 'Land Area and Dwelling Data' and 'SLA Land Survey Districts Data' from data.gov.sg. We will choose the most appropriate data along the project progress.The data contains the region boundary values of the place of interest.\n\n#### 3. Location Data of MRT Stations in Singapore\n\nThis data is collected from Google map API. The data contains the latitude and longitude of each MRT station in Singapore.\n\n#### 4. Top Venues Data for Towns in Singapore\nFor Venue recommendation, we will be using Foursquare API. We will be using Foursquare for exploring the neighborhood towns and MRT stations. Based on the data we will get the most common venues and we do clustering of the neighborhoods.\nWe will also query the ratings of each veneu in Foursquare.\n\n#### Pre Processing of Data\nHDB Flat prices within a block has variation due to the factors like - total floor area, number of rooms and unit level (storey) in the block. Since the project is not focusing on pricing recommendation, we will be using an average price of a unit in the block by minimizing the variables. We will drop or ignore the missing data here.\nFor the location data of Singapore Towns since we have more than one data set, we will do a comparison with the Towns described the HDB Resale price dataset and choose the most appropriate set.\nWe will merge datasets wherever it seems appropriate.\n\n#### Processing\nWe will be using 'explore' and 'getVenuesByCategory' features in Foursquare API to undestand the top venues in each town. Each town will be then clustered around the MRT stations.\nThe data will be plotted in matplotlib as well as Folium maps for a better visual understanding. Then we will compare each town and the HDB house pricing of each town. This will give an insight to the pricing variation of HDB houses in Singapore related to importance of the venues.",
